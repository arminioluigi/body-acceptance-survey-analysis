**Abstract**

In the last decades, the relationship between human beings and their own body has generated growing
interest. In particular, considerable attention has been drawn to the social and psychological issues
that are related to the perception that people have of their body, so that we have witnessed the
development and the growth of social movements that promote the concept of body positivity. At the
same time, a reasonably large amount of empirical literature about body perception has been
produced. Based on a survey concerning body care that involved 744 university students, I tried to
offer an additional contribution to the study of the factors that affect the self-perception of the body
in the students, considering demographic variables already used before in studies about body
perception, psychological features (i.e., the results of the Big 5 personality test and the Self-Esteem
Rosenberg test), as well as the personal opinions and attitudes of the interviewees. To analyse these
data, I resorted to regression modelling, whose results showed a controversial role of Neuroticism in
predicting body perception, and a surprising gender distribution of body acceptance, which was
higher in female students than in their male colleagues. At the same time, body shape acceptance
proved to be a complex variable to predict relying on socio-demographic and personality-related
variables. Then, to build a body-related social typology, I used latent class modelling, which allowed
me to classify the people according to their perceptions and opinions about themselves and the
different type of body shape that exist. Finally, another logistic regression model has been fitted to
analyse the relationship between body perception and body modification, controlling for 
sociodemographic and psychological variables, which showed a positive association between the perceived
body desirability and the tendency to modify oneâ€™s own body.
